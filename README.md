# timesheetpy

##  simple timesheet generator

timesheetpy is a small python tool that helps you generate a timesheet to be
filled out in XLSX (MS Excel) format. The format is of course, readable by
LibreOffice.

## dependencies

`python2` is required, along with the `xlsxwriter` external library. Use your
package manager or `pip` to find it and install it.

## usage

```
usage: timesheet [-h] [-sm START_MONTH] [-sy START_YEAR] [-em END_MONTH]
                 [-ey END_YEAR] [-o OUTPUT_FILE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -sm START_MONTH, --start-month START_MONTH
                        starting month, ex: 9
  -sy START_YEAR, --start-year START_YEAR
                        starting year, ex: 2016
  -em END_MONTH, --end-month END_MONTH
                        ending month, ex: 11
  -ey END_YEAR, --end-year END_YEAR
                        ending year, ex: 2016
  -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output-file OUTPUT_FILE
                        output file, ex: timesheet.xlsx
```

It is not necessary to specify any argument. In that case, timesheetpy will
create a timesheet for the current month called `timesheet.xlsx`
